# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

In this project, I took the source code that was supplied for the Horiseon webiste and refactored it to be more accessible and meet the acceptance criteria of the client. This primarily involved minor edits to the HTML in order to change many div elements to more useful semantic tags and working to consolidate some of the CSS styling that was repeatitive. 

## User Story

The client had the following user story:

* As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for searches.

## Acceptance Criteria

The client had the following acceptance criteria:

* It's done when the source code utilizes semantic HTML elements.
* It's done when the structure of the HTML elements follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* It's done when image elements contain accessible alt attributes.
* It's done when heading attributes fall in sequential order.
* It's done when the title element has a concise, descriptive title.
